# euler

This repository contains my solutions to various ProjectEuler problems, as well as a library containing shared solution code.

## Versioning

The common euler library adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). However, prior to 1.0.0 this project will adhere to the following rules:

- Any API/ABI breaking changes will result in a minor version bump.
- Any API extending features will result in a patch version bump.
- Any non-breaking bug fixes and performance improvements will result in a patch version bump.

This crate also includes several binaries (some tools, and one binary per problem). Adding / removing binaries, or modifying existing binaries, will not result in a version change. Version changes are used to track common library compatibility only.
